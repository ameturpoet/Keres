HOW TO MAKE AN ITEM

Note: It is probably easier to create a copy of an existing item and modify that than it is to create a new one from scratch

1. Required Scripts
---
    1: Attach an Interactable Script and adjust properties for best effect
        +ShowTooltip shows the Tooltip string if True
        +Tooltip is the string to show, should be something like "Pick up Red Key"
        +ShowControl shows the Control if True
    2: Attach an Item Script and adjust propertie for best effect
        +Name is the item's name, this is the name that will be used when displaying text, NOT the editor name
        +Value is how much the item is worth. Currently unused, but we may use it for a scoring system if we feel like it
        +QuestItem literally does nothing. I should probably get rid of this
    3: Attach an Item_ Script (such as Item_Key, Item_OxyTank, etc)
        The exact Item_ Script you attach determines how it is handled by the inventory
        
When the item is picked up by the player, it is moved to the location of the Inventory object that the player is connected to
and set as its child.
The player's 'inventory' is actually the list of objects attached to the Inventory object.
