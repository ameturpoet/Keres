HOW TO USE COMBINATION AND PERMUTATION LOCKS

Combination Lock: The order of the sequence doesn't matter
So, if the correct combination is 1-13-4, then the player could enter 4-1-13 and it would still be correct

Permutation Lock: The order does matter
So, if the correct permutation is ABC, then the player MUST enter ABC in that order to be correct

1. The Locks
---

There are 2 lock archetypes pre-made for both combination and permutation locks
They are Activator_CombinationLock and Activator_PermutationLock respectively

	1: Drag the lock archetype you need into the world
	2: Go to part 2. or 3. based on the one you chose

---
2. Combination Locks
---
	To configure a combination lock-

	1: Go into the MultiSwitch object's children
	2: Duplicate (or delete) subobjects to get the desired amount
	3: For each subobject, go in and change its MaxValue, MinValue, and CorrectValue
	
	The SubSwitch object has a number attached to it (CurrentValue) that goes up by 1 each time
	you press it. If the CurrentValue is greater than MaxValue, then it gets set to MinValue

	So, if MaxValue is 3, MinValue is 1, and CorrectValue is 2:
	
	Start: CurrentValue = 1
	Push1: CurrentValue = 2, SubSwitch is correct now
	Push2: CurrentValue = 3, SubSwitch is no longer correct
	Push3: CurrentValue = 1

---
3. Permutation Locks
---
	To configure a permutation lock-
	
	1: Go into the MultiSwitch object's children
	2: Duplicate (or delete) subobjects to get the desired amount
	3: Change each subobject's name to A SINGLE CHARACTER (e.g., 'A', '1', '@', etc.)
	4: In the MultiSwitch, go to the Activator_Multiswitch script and change the CorrectSequence
	   to the desired sequence

	*NOTE*: The CorrectSequence MUST be made of characters that were used for the subswitches' names
	If the CorrectSequence is ABZ, and you only have switches named A, B, and C, then the MultiSwitch
	will NEVER activate

	*NOTE2*: The same character can be used multiple times in the CorrectSequence, like AAB, CBBA, BBBB, etc.
