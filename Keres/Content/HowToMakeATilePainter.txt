HOW TO MAKE A TILE PAINTER

Note: Again, it's easier to copy an existing TilePainter and change its properties to what you need

---
1. The Painter
---
    The painter is the object that gets spawned in by the MaterialMap and does the actual painting

    1: Attach the TileMaterial script to the object and adjust its properties for the desired effect
        +FloorMaterial is the Material that will be applied to the floor
        +WallMaterial is the Material that will be applied to the walls
        +CeilingMaterial is the Material that will be applied to the ceiling
    2: Attach the NavigationEvents script to the TilePainter. This controls the order in which level generation occurs and makes sure
       that things work properly

---
2. The Spawning Tile
---
    1: Duplicate the tileMAT_Test Archetype and name the Archetype appropriately. DO NOT CHANGE THE OBJECT'S NAME, JUST THE ARCHETYPE'S NAME
       (E.g., name it tileMAT_BrickWall for a painter that makes brick walls. This just makes organization easier)
    2: Change the properties of the Tile_Replace3D script
        +Change the MainProp to the TilePainter you made in step 1
        +The Type should be TilePainter, and only JustProp should be checked off

---
3. Adding the Tile to the Palette
---
    1: Select the TileEditor2D tool and set the TilePalette to TextureMapPallette*
    2: Click on a space that doesn't already have a sprite on it, this will create a new tile
    3: Adjust the properties of the tile you've just made
        +Change the Archetype to the spawning tile you made in step 2 (the one you named tileMAT_name)
        +Change the Sprite to something distinct. Typically, you want a custom SpriteSource that has the wall texture in the center of it,
          the ceiling texture on top, and the floor texture on the bottom. This makes it easier when designing the level, as you'll be able to
          quickly see the textures that you're painting
    4: Set the Collision to None. Just click the red X next to the list to do this
    5: MAKE SURE THAT Mergeable IS SET TO FALSE. THIS WILL SCREW LITERALLY EVERYTHING UP IF YOU ALLOW THE TILES TO MERGE
    6: Paint the tile onto the MaterialMap, it should repaint the geometry around it to the textures you attached to it

*Yes, Pallette is misspelled. Deal with it.
