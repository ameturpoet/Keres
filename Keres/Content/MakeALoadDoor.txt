HOW TO MAKE A LOAD DOOR

---
1. The Door
---
    The LoadDoor loads a new area when opened.
    
    1. Drag the Door_Load archetype into the level and position as needed
    2. In the Interactable_LoadGate script, change the LoadLevel property to the level you want to go to
    3. Go to the level you specified in part 2 and create a new object, it can be the default archetype or whatever it doesn't really matter
    4. Name your object something unique
    5. Rotate your object around the Z-Axis to face in the direction you want the player facing when they enter the door
        0 = facing up
        90 = facing left
        180 = facing down
        270 or -90 = facing right
    6. Go back to the door in the other level
    7. Set the TargetNodeName property in the Interactable_LoadGate script to the unique name you gave your object in step 4
    8. To make a 2-way door, just create a second LoadDoor on where the node you made is and have it lead to a node in front of the first door
