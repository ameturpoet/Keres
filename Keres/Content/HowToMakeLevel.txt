HOW TO MAKE A NEW LEVEL

Note: All Archetypes you need to spawn in are tagged with the 'LevelDesign' tag for convenience

---
1. Player & Camera
---
    1: Drag the Player archetype into the level
    2: In the objects list (lower-right corner), click and drag the Camera onto the Player, this parents the Camera to the Player
    3: Set the Camera's Translation to (0, 0, 0) and its Rotation to (90, 0, 0)
    4: On the Camera's Camera script, set the ProjectionMode to 'Perspective', and its NearPlane to 0.0001
    5: In the objects list (lower-right corner again), there should be an object called 'Taser' attached to the Player. Click and drag the Taser onto the Camera.
       This attached the Taser to the Camera.

2. Level Generating Objects
---
    1: In the objects list, select the LevelSettings object. Attach the 'LoadHUD' script to it.
    2: In the LevelSettings' LoadHUD script, set the HUDLevel property to 'HUDLevel'
    3: Drag the Level_Generator archetype anywhere into the level. The LevelGenerator initializes all level generation events, ensuring that the geometry and
       pathing grid work properly
    4: Drag the LevelGeometry archetype anywhere into the level and set its Translation to (0, 0, 0). The LevelGeometry can be used to make the entire level
       shake, move, or rotate if we need to.

3. Tilemaps and Level Generation
---

    1: Select the TileEditor2D tool and create a new TileMap.
    2: Select the LevelDesignPallette* and use it to design the level. The tiles themselves spawn in the level geometry
        +Light gray sections indicate floor and ceiling
        +Dark gray sections are blank space
        +Purple lines are walls
    3: Click CreateTileMap to create another tile map for the material painting, rename it MaterialMap or something different to differentiate it from the first TileMap
    4: Select the TextureMapPallette* and paint over the locations of all tiles on the first TileMap. The tiles in the TextureMapPallette spawn in objects that paint the
       level with different textures. The textures to be painted should match the icon on the MaterialMap
    5: Set the MaterialMap's Translation to (0, 0, 1). This seperates it from the TileMap and makes it look better in the editor

---
4. Planets and Decorations
---
    1: Drag the Skybox into the level and set its Translation to (0, 0, 0)
       Can be resized to achieve desired effect
    2: Drag the planet** Pluto into the level and position wherever looks best
    3: Drag the Pluto_Lighting archetype into the level and position near Pluto for the best effect
    4: Drag the planet_Sun archetype*** into the level and position it for best effect, typically on the opposite end of the level from Pluto

*Yes, the word Palette is misspelled. Don't question it.

**Pluto is planet. Don't let those crazy scientists tell you otherwise

***I don't know why the archetype is called planet_Sun. I mean, I made it, but I really couldn't answer that question if you asked me.
