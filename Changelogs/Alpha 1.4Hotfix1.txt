NEW BUGS
---
+All text that was centered (menu buttons without unique sprites, the letters on the rader)
 is no longer centered. The Zero team removed the ability to define where your
 text begins vertically, so all text that should be right on the center of its
 coordinates is not shifted down slightly.
